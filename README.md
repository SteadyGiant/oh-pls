# Oh PLS

Cleaning the [Public Libraries Survey](https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/public-libraries-survey) is easy.

This repo combines and cleans every PLS CSV into one big CSV (a "tidy,"" "long," or "panel" dataset). Use it to analyze trends in library data over time. Beware the many pitfalls in this dataset and read the docs!

## TODO

- Document data quality issues and caveats.
- Automatically download & extract each CSV into a temporary directory.
